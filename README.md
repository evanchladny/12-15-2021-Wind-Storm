# December 15, 2021 Wind Storm

This reanalysis looks at the intensity, geospacial, and temporal scale of the December 15, 2021, wind storm in the Midwest.

A very pronounced and deep low moved off the Rockies throughout the day on the 15th. As the low moved over Nebraksa, Kansas, and Oklahoma, wind gusts exceeding 100 miles per hour occured in large swaths across Kansas and southern Nebraska.

In my reanalysis, I used ERA5 data for the day to understand the broad system and what areas recieved the highest winds. To further showcase where the highest winds were, I highlighted the 100 mph contour in the gust maps. Finally, I plotted all the areas that experienced 100+ mph wind gusts.

In the 'Output' file, there are 'GIFs' and 'Images' folders. The 'Images' folder simply contains the frames that are found the GIFs in the 'GIFs' folder.
